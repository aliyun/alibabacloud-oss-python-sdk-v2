        Args:
            region (str, required): The region in which the bucket is located.
            endpoint (str, optional): The domain names that other services can use to access OSS.
            credentials_provider (CredentialsProvider, optional): The credentials provider to use when signing requests.
            connect_timeout (int|float, optional): The time in seconds till a timeout exception is thrown
                when attempting to make a connection. The default is 10 seconds.
            readwrite_timeout (int|float, optional): The time in seconds till a timeout exception is thrown
                when attempting to read from a connection. The default is 20 seconds.
            retry_max_attempts (int, optional): Specifies the maximum number attempts an API client will call
                an operation that fails with a retryable error.
            retryer (Retryer, optional): Guides how HTTP requests should be retried in case of recoverable failures.
            http_client (HttpClient, optional): The HTTP client to invoke API calls with.
            use_cname (bool, optional): If the endpoint is s CName, set this flag to true
            use_path_style (bool, optional): Allows you to enable the client to use path-style addressing, 
                i.e., https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/bucket/key.
            signature_version (str, optional): The signature version when signing requests. Valid values v4, v1
            disable_ssl (bool, optional): Forces the endpoint to be resolved as HTTP.
            insecure_skip_verify (bool, optional): Skip server certificate verification.
            enabled_redirect (bool, optional): Enable http redirect or not. Default is disable
            use_dualstack_endpoint (bool, optional): Dual-stack endpoints are provided in some regions.
                This allows an IPv4 client and an IPv6 client to access a bucket by using the same endpoint.
                Set this to True to use a dual-stack endpoint for the requests.
            use_accelerate_endpoint (bool, optional): OSS provides the transfer acceleration feature to accelerate date transfers
                of data uploads and downloads across countries and regions.
                Set this to True to use a accelerate endpoint for the requests.
            use_internal_endpoint (bool, optional): You can use an internal endpoint to communicate between Alibaba Cloud services located 
                within the same region over the internal network. You are not charged for the traffic generated over the internal network.
                Set this to True to use a internal endpoint for the requests.
            proxy_host: (str, optional): The proxy setting.
            disable_upload_crc64_check: (bool, optional): Check data integrity of uploads via the crc64 by default.
                This feature takes effect for put_object, append_object, upload_part, uploader.upload_from and uploader.upload_file
                Set this to `true` to disable this feature.
            disable_download_crc64_check: (bool, optional): Check data integrity of uploads via the crc64 by default.
                This feature only takes effect for downloader.download_file, get_object_to_file.
                Set this to `true` to disable this feature.
            additional_headers: (List[str], optional): Additional signable headers.
            user_agent: (str, optional): The optional user specific identifier appended to the User-Agent header.
